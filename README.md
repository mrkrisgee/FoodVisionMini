# FoodVisionMini

A series of experiments designed to grant a deeper understanding of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures.

This project aims to train various models on a subset of the <em>[Food101 Image Data Set](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/datasets_extra/food-101/)<em> to identify which model performs best. That model will then be used in the [FoodVision repo](https://github.com/mrkrisgee/FoodVision) to train the whole Data Set and perform predictions on images of food.
